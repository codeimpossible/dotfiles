# Uses the Sunrise/Sunset API (http://api.sunrise-sunset.org/) to set the OS X
# computer's desktop picture based on local daylight. The potential time periods
# are night, sunrise, day, and sunset. Sunrise is defined as the time between
# when astronomical twilight begins and the sun is above the horizon. Sunset is
# defined as when the sun begins dipping below the horizon and the end of
# astronomical twilight.
#
# This program depends on the `whereami` and `jq` utilities. If these are not
# installed, then `homebrew` will detect this and ask if you'd like to install
# them.
#
# This program assumes that pictures will be available for use in:
#
#   ~/Library/Desktop Pictures/Sunrise/
#   ~/Library/Desktop Pictures/Day/
#   ~/Library/Desktop Pictures/Sunset/
#   ~/Library/Desktop Pictures/Night/
#
# A picture will be chosen at random from the appropriate folder. This script
# is meant to be run as a Mac OS LaunchAgent, and an example .plist can be found
# in this repo at local/share/LaunchAgents/com.codeimpossible.update-wallpaper.plist
#
# To have this script run automatically throughout the day, copy that file into
# ~/Library/LaunchAgents and edit values as necessary to be usable by your own
# user. Then, run:
#
#   launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.codeimpossible.update-wallpaper.plist
